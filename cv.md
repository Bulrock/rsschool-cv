#### BRIEFLY ABOUT ME<br/>
Me name is Maksim. I'm 33 years old. I've been working as a civil engineer more than 10 years. During this period I became a good specialist in my field.<br/>
But I've reached maximum in this field and I decided to try something new. Frontend development was always interesting for me. It has a lot of technologies where possible to see immediately the result of your work.
My goal is to gain new knowledge, experience that will allow me to work as a frontend developer. And I hope RS School helps me to reach it.
